Manuel has a background in sport science and data science and has been involved in studies involving football analytics using optical tracing.
His PhD focuses on using voice to assess the risk of diabetes-related complications. Diabetes can affect organs involved in voice and speech production. By analyzing the voice and vocal biomarkers, the aim is to monitor and diagnose conditions such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and diabetes distress. During the project, he will collect new data and develop machine learning models to predict these complications, contributing to innovative monitoring methods for diabetes in the future.
