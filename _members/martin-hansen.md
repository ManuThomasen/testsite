Martin is a medical doctor with a research background in public health. During his PhD at Aarhus University, he studied environmental risk factors for non-communicable diseases (including diabetes) in low- and middle-income countries. He has experience conducting both epidemiological surveys and register research.
Martin works part-time as a clinician at the Department of Infectious Diseases at Aarhus University Hospital, and part-time as a researcher at Steno Diabetes Center, where he is developing a clinical risk score for the prediction of prevalent diabetes among African adults. He has a passion for global health and health equity, and will combine machine learning methods with his experience living and working in low-income countries (Bolivia and Uganda) to ensure that the tool developed is usable in real-world settings.
