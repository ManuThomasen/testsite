Anders is a medical doctor with a PhD in diabetes epidemiology. During his PhD, he investigated what particular risks having type 2 diabetes poses to migrants in Denmark. He gained extensive experience in working with the Danish registries, with a special focus on developing an algorithm to identify diabetes diagnoses. He has a passion for open science, teaching and disseminating best practices in using R. As a postdoc, he will ensure the clinical relevance of the prediction models developed by the group, he will develop machine learning models himself, and will continue a research line in classical, register-based studies. The latter will contribute to building bridges across Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, e.g. to the Integrated Care Research Unit.
