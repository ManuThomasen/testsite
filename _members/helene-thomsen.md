Helene has a background in Biomedical Engineering, focusing on machine learning and health data.
During her studies at Aalborg University, Helene developed a passion for programming, which led her to pursue a PhD in the interdisciplinary field of diabetes research and data science.
In her PhD, she works on developing deep learning models for cardiovascular risk assesments in individuals with diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring data. By using transfer learning between studies, she aims to transfer knowledge between epidemiological and clinical cohorts, and to improve algorithmic fairness. Additionally, her research includes developing a prediction model for blood glucose spikes in order to tailor diet recommendations and assist risk assessments of cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes.
