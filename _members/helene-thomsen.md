Helene has a background in Biomedical Engineering, focusing on machine learning and health data.
During her studies, Helene developed a passion for programming, which led her to pursue a PhD in the interdisciplinary field of healthcare and data science.
In her PhD, she works on developing prediction models for cardiovascular risk assesments in individuals with diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring data and transfer learning between studies, with the perspective of algorithmic fairness. Additionally, her research includes developing a model for predicting blood glucose spikes in order to tailor diet recommendations and assist risk assessments of cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes. 

This PhD is being conducted under the supervision of Adam hulman (Associate Professor at Aarhus University) and co-supervision of Coen Stehouwer (Professor at Maastricht University Medical Center) and Dorte Vistisen (Associate Professor at University of Copenhagen), as well as in collaboration with Matthew Fenech (co-founder of Una Health).
