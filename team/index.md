Our lab shares the passion for data science and a thrive to make a difference for people with diabetes. We come from diverse backgrounds (data science, engineering, epidemiology, mathematics, medicine, sport science) and enjoy collaborations across disciplines. We aim to create a professional working environment that embraces our differences, encourages out-of-the-box thinking, and where there is a place for the famous Danish ‘hygge’.
