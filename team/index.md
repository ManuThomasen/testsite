Our lab shares the passion for data science and a thrive to make a difference for people with diabetes. We come from diverse backgrounds (data science, engineering, epidemiology, mathematics, medicine, sport science) and enjoy collaborations across disciplines. We aim to create a professional working environment that embraces our differences, encourages out-of-the-box thinking, and where there is a place for the famous Danish ‘hygge’.

Doing a PhD or a research year require a significant committment. Therefore, we offer students, who are interested in working with us, an opportunity to get connected to our group via scientific, social and networking activities, and hope that these experiences will lead to more informed decisions about their career paths and eventually to fruitful collaborations with our group.
