<p>It is important for us to launch a <a href="https://hulmanlab.com">website</a> and a <a href="https://mailchi.mp/rm/hulman-lab-newsletter">newsletter</a>, 
because we’d like to extend our communication beyond publishing scientific articles and presenting at conferences. 
We will use these channels to give a better picture of who we are, what projects we work on, and our activities 
(e.g. workshops, seminars, journal clubs, patient involment sessions).</p>

<p>My mother saw math in everything around us; in the geometry of a bridge we drove across, in the permutations of numbers that make up my birthday.
Growing up she would get excited as she explained the solution to a math problem.
She would tell me that <em>math is beautiful</em>.
As a high school student, I remember thinking that math was simply a graduation requirement.
However my understanding and appreciation for math soon changed.
After taking an applied mathematics course in college (Bryn Mawr College), I discovered how math paired with computer science could be used to model and solve real world problems such as predicting the spread of influenza virus through a population given different control measures such as antiviral drugs.
This course introduced me to mathematical concepts that allowed me to make quasi-discoveries within a simplified dynamical system.
I found the beauty in math was combining it with computer science to translate science and research to clinical applications – It was exciting that I could make discoveries about seal populations with a few lines of code and some math equations!</p>

<p>I started to actively pursue opportunities to continue applying computational methods to science problems.
This eventually lead to me to start a graduate degree program in Genomics and Computational Biology at the University of Pennsylvania in 2017.
In 2018, I joined Casey Greene’s lab, which has a lot of expertise in using deep learning methods to study biology.
Despite having a computational background, I had a lot to learn about what deep learning was.
Additionally, my educational background was purely computational and so I also needed to learn biology – in my first graduate course I remember my first question was “what is a gene?”</p>

<p>After a long journey, I have published a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.066597v1">paper</a> using a generative multi-layer neural network to simulate compendia of gene expression experiments from large-scale microbial and human datasets.
I have contributed to a community-written <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules">manuscript</a> about tips for using deep learning in biology.
Overall, my dissertation research has focused on using deep learning methods to extract patterns from large-scale gene expression datasets.
I am currently applying these methods to understand mechanisms of <em>P.aeruginosa</em> infection.
My goal is to develop methods that help gain insight into the complexities of disease traits.
You can find my current research projects on my <a href="https://github.com/ajlee21">github page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deep-learning-in-biology-workshop">Deep learning in biology workshop</h2>

<p>To celebrate and pass on the knowledge, my lab mate, <a href="https://ben-heil.github.io/">Ben Heil</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/localee_compact">I</a> are hosting a <a href="https://ben-heil.github.io/2020-10-08-workshop/">“Deep Learning for Biologists Workshop”</a>.</p>

<p>For biologists with no computational background, we hope that after this course:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You will have an idea of what deep learning is</li>
  <li>You will be inspired to find applications of deep learning in your own research</li>
</ol>

<p>For those with some computational background, you will also gain an intuitive sense for how these methods work with a little bit of math (what else would you expect from a former math major).</p>

<p>We know the idea of deep learning feels very daunting, but we know that you can learn this too!</p>

<p>Come join us <strong>Thursday, October 29 at 11am - 2pm EST.</strong></p>

<p>Registration can be found <a href="https://ben-heil.github.io/2020-10-08-workshop/">here</a></p>
