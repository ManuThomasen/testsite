## Machine Learning & Clinical Prediction (MLCP) Journal Club
MLCP journal club, a monthly, interdisciplinary journal club for anyone interested in machine learning and/or clinical prediction.  We cover technical aspects, but the focus is ultimately on the practical, clinical use-cases of machine learning (e.g. for clinical prediction of cardiovascular disease), where we dissect pitfalls and limitations to cut through the hype.
