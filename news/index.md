## Past events
### Steno AI Journal Club
**Date, time** May 23, 15-16

**Location** Skillerummet 1, Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (see [Contact](https://hulmanlab.com/contact/) page)

**Description** The first article we will discuss is neither about machine learning, nor about artificial intelligence. 
We will discuss the basic concepts of association and prediction which are often confused in diabetes research. 
Just read the following [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33068662/) beforehand and gather your thoughts and questions:
Association is not prediction: A landscape of confused reporting in diabetes - A systematic review by Tibor V. Varga et al.

### Steno AI Art Cafe
**Date, time** May 16, 15-16

**Location** Krearummet, Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (see [Contact](https://hulmanlab.com/contact/) page)

**Description** We will meet for an informal workshop introducing participants to an AI tool called Midjourney. In Midjourney, users can generate images using text prompts describing their vision. After a short introduction to prompting and some of the features the program has, we will try Midjourney in smaller groups of 3-4 and create images around a theme relevant from a health perspective. At the end, we will share the generated images with each other and discuss how the experience of using AI was and how we could integrate such tools in our daily work.
